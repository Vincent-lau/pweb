Hello, my name is Shuntian Liu.

I am a student studying Computer Science @ University of Cambridge.

I am interested in the development of distributed systems, as well as some theoretical
parts such as model checking, type theory and denotational semantics, or better
yet, an intersection between these two!

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss anything in my posts.
